# hangman-game
Objective:

The goal is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.
If you guess the word before running out of attempts, you win!
Basic Rules:
Setup: A word or phrase is chosen, and each letter is replaced by an underscore (_), representing each letter of the word.

Guessing:

You guess letters one at a time.
If the letter is in the word, all instances of that letter are revealed.
If the letter is not in the word, you lose a "life." Often, this is represented by drawing a part of a "hangman" stick figure.
Lives:

You have a limited number of incorrect guesses (typically 6-10). Each wrong guess brings the hangman figure closer to completion.
If the entire hangman figure is drawn, you lose the game.
Winning:

You win if you can guess all the letters in the word before running out of lives.
